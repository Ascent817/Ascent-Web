                        Renewable energy is cheap, green, and clean, but the biggest drawback to it is that it can't be stored easily. 
                        Oil can be stored cheaply in barrels and tanks, but renewable energy has to be stored in expensive, ecologically 
                        damaging batteries. This is the problem that Pumped Hydropower Storage attempts to solve. By storing electricity as 
                        gravitational potential energy, this technology can cut huge costs to your wallet and the ecosystem.
